The Atheist Community of Toronto is a new informal network of individuals interested in building a community of atheists in the city. We are still a work in progress. Our first meet-up for drinks was in July 2014. We host social get-togethers and some of our members are beginning to work on outreach and activism. Many of us just want to socialize with other atheists.

By “atheist” we mean an individual who lacks a belief in any gods.

Some, but by no means all of us, also think that belief in gods is often harmful and we want to do what we can to reduce any harm caused by theistic or religious beliefs. This is what the outreach and activism project is about, as well as taking action to reduce any unjust negative stereotypes of atheists.

Right now this is basically a site to help us keep in touch, plan what the group is going to be about and coordinate activities.

There is nothing to join right now and all our events are free. Check out our [events](/events) page and come meet us, or get in touch to be involved in activism if that’s your thing. Join our [Facebook Group](/facebook) for updates and discussion.
